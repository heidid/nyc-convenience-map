# living conveniently in nyc
if you wanted to live in NYC and you were super lazy and wanted to be able to walk to Target and Trader Joe's within 5 minutes, where could you live?

## data sources
* coordinates of Target and Trader Joe's locations mostly from OpenStreetMap, a few from Bing Maps
* isochrones from Mapbox Isochrone API
* subway lines from [chriswhong/mapboxgl-nyc-subway](https://github.com/chriswhong/mapboxgl-nyc-subway/tree/master)
